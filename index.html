            The Roman Emperor imprisoned Valentine 
            for his insolence and later beheaded him
             on February 14 for refusing to forsake 
             his faith, thus making him a “saint” for 
             his martyrdom. A legend surrounding a 
             different (or the same?) Valentine weaves
              a love story between Valentine and his jailer's
               blind daughter, Julia.
